## 📚 Overview
This project, developed for the ME301A Energy Systems course, presents a comparative analysis of **Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)** versus **coal-fired power plants**. The study focuses on two primary criteria: **thermal efficiency** and **cost sustainability**, highlighting EGS as a more eco-friendly and efficient solution for energy generation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of EGS and coal-fired power plants with a focus on:
- **Thermal Efficiency**: Assessing energy output efficiency relative to fuel or geothermal input.
- **Cost Sustainability**: Comparing the economic aspects, including setup costs, operational expenses, and environmental costs, to establish EGS as a potentially viable alternative.

---

## 🛠 Approach
The analysis is conducted through a series of focused steps:

1. **Thermal Efficiency Analysis**  
   - Calculated and compared thermal efficiencies, showing EGS systems reaching up to 90% efficiency versus coal’s typical 30-40%.

2. **Cost Analysis**  
   - Performed a comprehensive cost comparison of initial installation, ongoing operational expenses, and environmental costs.
   - Findings suggest that although EGS has higher initial costs, it offers reduced operational and environmental expenses over the system’s lifetime.

3. **Energy Conversion Efficiency Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated overall energy conversion efficiencies to underscore EGS as a more sustainable option in energy output per unit of input.

4. **Environmental Impact Analysis**  
   - Compared carbon emissions, air quality impact, and long-term ecological effects, showing that EGS has a significantly smaller environmental footprint than coal-fired power plants.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Higher Efficiency**: EGS systems achieve thermal efficiencies as high as 90%, substantially outperforming coal-fired systems.
- **Economic Sustainability**: Despite higher upfront installation costs, EGS offers significant cost savings in long-term operation and environmental impact.
- **Lower Environmental Impact**: EGS emits far fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases, aligning better with sustainable energy goals than coal-fired alternatives.

---

## 📈 Results
The comparative analysis concluded that **Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)** are a more efficient and sustainable energy solution than traditional coal-fired power plants, due to:
- **High thermal efficiency** that maximizes energy output.
- **Long-term cost benefits** despite initial setup costs, thanks to lower operational and environmental expenses.
- **Sustainability advantages** with minimal environmental harm, establishing EGS as a viable choice for a low-carbon energy future.
